Q5:Implement a function update_grade that takes the student's name and a new grade as parameters and updates the grade of the corresponding student record in the student_records dictionary.
Q6:Convert the student_records dictionary to JSON format and save it to a file named "student_data.json".
Q7:Read the "student_data.json" file, convert the JSON data back to a dictionary, and assign it to a variable called data.
